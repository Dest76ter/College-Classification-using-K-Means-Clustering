# College Classification using K-Means Clustering

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of K-Means Clustering in Python for the classification of colleges into two categories: private and public. The dataset used for this project contains various features of colleges, and K-Means clustering is applied to group colleges based on their characteristics.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes handling missing values and scaling.
- **Visualizations:** Utilizes seaborn for data exploration.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Classifies colleges into two clusters.
- **Evaluation:** Uses a confusion matrix and classification report for assessment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform heart disease classification.

**Note:** The dataset used in this project is for demonstration purposes only.

**Disclaimer:** This project may include code or concepts inspired by online tutorials and resources, with credit to the original creators.
